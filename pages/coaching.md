# Kurtis Johnson

An experienced basketball coach and mentor, passionate about developing players into future leaders through a lifelong commitment to the game.

Following playing experience at junior international, universities and senior national league, I’ve translated this learning and insight into coaching across various levels. I’m passionate about learning - always striving to develop my coaching craft through the latest research and trends from across the globe. Whether that’s through a modern approach to skill acquisition, exploring conceptual offence or applying leadership and development techniques from the corporate world.
