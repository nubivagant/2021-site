I do change stuff, mostly in the public sector, with just enough internet.

This means designing strategies for doing, delivering and managing products, and shaping services and organisations. Using the best of internet era ways of working to coach teams, make change happen and help organisations thrive in a networked world.

### Currently...

I'm a Design Lead in our Service and Organisation practice at [TPX Impact (formerly FutureGov &#9829;)](https://www.tpximpact.com) – a digital, design and transformation consultancy building a better future for people, places and the planet.

### Before that...

I was figuring out local government at [Leicestershire County Council](http://leicestershire.gov.uk/), leading the digital services team; a clever, multi-disciplinary bunch trying to make things better for residents. Prior to that, I was part of the Futures Directorate at [Orbit Housing Group](http://www.orbit.org.uk/), in the digital team at [Cogent Digital](https://www.cogent.co.uk/), Innovation R&D Officer at International development charity [Practical Action](http://practicalaction.org/) & Graduate Trainee at [Dare London](https://thisisdare.com/).
