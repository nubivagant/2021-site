# Kurtis Johnson

An experienced organisational strategy and change professional, working across the public, private and third sectors to create sustainable and meaningful technology-enabled change.

I like thinking deeply and acting boldly, with rigour and craft to create meaningful change with and for people. I've spent the last decade mostly trying to turn problems into opportunities of value, by reimagining organisations through strategy and transformation.
