# Kurtis Johnson

Hello! I'm a strategic digital leader with over eight years experience shaping how organisations design, deliver and  improve products and services that meet the needs of real people. I lead multidisciplinary teams across organisation design, service design, research and delivery by setting direction, building capability, and creating the conditions for people to do their best work.

I'm drawn to complex, mission driven problems where getting things right genuinely matters. My approach combines the craft of user-centred practice with pragmatic delivery, always grounded in measurable outcomes and meaningful sustainable change.
