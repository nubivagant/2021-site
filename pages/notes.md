I write, infrequently, about organisations, change, and the gap between how things work and how they could. Itâ€™s mostly to make sense of what I see. The friction between good intentions that meet messy reality. Most of this comes from being embedded in the machinery of organisational change, and trying to connect it to history, broader questions about how we organise ourselves, and what it takes to shift things that feel immovable. Enjoy!
