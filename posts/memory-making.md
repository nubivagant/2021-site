My infatuation with food and restaurant and craft and process, and most things in-between, likely began here; my grandma’s coffee shop. In hindsight it wasn’t just a shop. It was a refuge. A safe place. Honest work. Love and care. The scones were legendary. In all likelihood I’ve probably layered on a thick dollop of nostalgia-driven rosiness. But I guess that doesn’t matter. We shape our memories with hindsight. As time elapses we remember things differently. They mean different things to us based on where we are in the present. And that’s ok.

I think a lot about making memories. I used to put an awful lot of pressure on myself to make sure that I was making the right kind of memories for my children. Then I realised that we all apply our own internal filters to the things that happen to us, and experiences that shape us. So all you can really do is enjoy the ride whilst you can. Be present and in the moment as much as possible, and see what sticks.
